This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating insurance whether the client
will hire an Attorney or not.
Performed EDA and data Cleaning with various Python libraries like pandas, numpy,
matplotlib, and seaborn. To identify the relation between each Categorical Variable performed
data exploration and obtained visuals with the help of Bi - Variate analysis and identified the
pattern in the data.
Executed data preprocessing using label encoding and one hot encoding.
Implemented LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, SVC
(Support Vector Classifier), KNeighborsClassifier Algorithms and evaluated the results based
on training testing data.
